# Queen of Sheba (Makeda)

**Queen of Sheba** (ንግሥተ ሳባ), known in Ethiopian tradition as **Makeda** (ማከዳ), is a legendary and possibly historical queen who ruled in ancient times and is celebrated in Biblical, Quranic, and Ethiopian Orthodox traditions. According to Ethiopian sources, particularly the *Kebra Nagast* (Glory of the Kings), she was a powerful queen who ruled from Axum and famously visited King Solomon in Jerusalem around the 10th century BCE. While the historical existence of the Queen of Sheba remains a subject of scholarly debate, her cultural and religious significance in Ethiopian tradition, where she is considered the founder of the Solomonic dynasty, is immense and enduring.

## Historical and Archaeological Context

The question of the Queen of Sheba's historical existence and location has been debated by scholars for centuries. Archaeological and textual evidence suggests that the ancient kingdom of Saba (Sheba) was located in what is now Yemen and parts of the Horn of Africa, with trade connections extending across the Red Sea region.

### Ancient Sabean Civilization

Archaeological evidence from both Yemen and northern Ethiopia reveals the existence of sophisticated ancient civilizations that engaged in extensive trade networks. The Sabean kingdom in Yemen and the pre-Axumite civilizations in northern Ethiopia shared cultural, linguistic, and commercial connections that could provide the historical backdrop for the Queen of Sheba narrative.

Inscriptions found in both regions mention powerful queens and female rulers, suggesting that women held significant political power in these ancient Arabian and Horn of African societies. The practice of female rulership in pre-Islamic Arabia and ancient Ethiopia provides historical context for the biblical and traditional accounts of a powerful queen from this region.

### Pre-Axumite and Early Axumite Period

The timeframe traditionally associated with the Queen of Sheba (10th century BCE) corresponds to the pre-Axumite period in northern Ethiopia, when sophisticated urban centers and trade networks were developing. Archaeological sites such as Yeha, Beta Giyorgis, and other ancient settlements in Tigray provide evidence of advanced civilizations that could have supported a powerful kingdom ruled by the Queen of Sheba.

Recent archaeological discoveries in northern Ethiopia have revealed evidence of ancient palaces, temples, and urban centers that date to the relevant period, suggesting that the region possessed the political and economic sophistication necessary to support a powerful queen and her court.

## Biblical and Quranic Accounts

The Queen of Sheba appears in both the Hebrew Bible and the Quran, where she is portrayed as a wise and wealthy ruler who visited King Solomon in Jerusalem.

### Biblical Narrative

In the Hebrew Bible (1 Kings 10:1-13 and 2 Chronicles 9:1-12), the Queen of Sheba is described as hearing of Solomon's wisdom and traveling to Jerusalem with a great caravan bearing gold, spices, and precious stones. The biblical account emphasizes her wealth, wisdom, and the mutual respect between her and Solomon.

The biblical narrative describes her as testing Solomon with difficult questions and being impressed by his wisdom, his palace, and the organization of his kingdom. After their meeting, she praised Solomon's God and returned to her own land with gifts from the Israelite king.

### Quranic Account

The Quran (Surah 27:20-44) provides a more detailed account of the Queen of Sheba, referred to as Bilqis in Islamic tradition. The Quranic narrative includes additional elements such as her initial consultation with her advisors, her strategic response to Solomon's invitation, and her eventual conversion to monotheism.

The Quranic account emphasizes themes of wisdom, proper governance, and the recognition of divine truth. It portrays the queen as a thoughtful ruler who seeks counsel from her advisors and ultimately recognizes the superiority of Solomon's monotheistic faith over her people's previous beliefs.

## Ethiopian Orthodox Tradition and the Kebra Nagast

Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity has developed the most elaborate and detailed traditions surrounding the Queen of Sheba, identifying her explicitly with Ethiopia and making her central to Ethiopian national and religious identity.

### The Kebra Nagast Narrative

The *Kebra Nagast* (Glory of the Kings), compiled in the 13th-14th centuries but claiming to preserve much older traditions, provides the most comprehensive Ethiopian account of the Queen of Sheba. According to this text, Makeda was a powerful queen who ruled from Axum and controlled extensive trade networks across the Red Sea region.

The *Kebra Nagast* describes how Makeda learned of Solomon's wisdom through a merchant named Tamrin, who had visited Jerusalem. Intrigued by accounts of Solomon's justice and wisdom, she decided to visit him herself, traveling with a great caravan carrying precious gifts including gold, spices, and precious stones from her kingdom.

### The Solomonic Dynasty Legend

Perhaps most significantly for Ethiopian tradition, the *Kebra Nagast* claims that Makeda and Solomon had a romantic relationship that resulted in the birth of a son, Menelik I, who became the founder of the Ethiopian imperial dynasty. According to this tradition, Menelik I brought the Ark of the Covenant from Jerusalem to Ethiopia, where it has remained ever since.

This narrative became central to Ethiopian imperial ideology, with Ethiopian emperors claiming descent from this union between the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The tradition provided religious and historical legitimacy for Ethiopian rulership and established Ethiopia's special relationship with the biblical tradition.

### Religious Significance in Ethiopian Orthodoxy

In Ethiopian Orthodox tradition, the Queen of Sheba is venerated as a righteous ruler who recognized divine truth and helped establish Ethiopia's covenant relationship with God. Her story is integrated into Ethiopian liturgical traditions and continues to be celebrated in religious festivals and church art.

The tradition emphasizes her wisdom, her recognition of true religion, and her role in bringing divine blessing to Ethiopia through her son Menelik I. She is portrayed as a model ruler who combined political power with religious devotion and moral wisdom.

## Cultural and Artistic Representations

The Queen of Sheba has been depicted in Ethiopian art, literature, and popular culture for centuries, becoming one of the most recognizable figures in Ethiopian cultural tradition.

### Church Art and Manuscripts

Ethiopian Orthodox churches contain numerous artistic depictions of the Queen of Sheba, often showing her meeting with King Solomon or her journey to Jerusalem. These artistic representations emphasize her royal dignity, her wisdom, and her role in Ethiopian salvation history.

Illuminated manuscripts from various periods include detailed illustrations of the Queen of Sheba narrative, often incorporating distinctly Ethiopian artistic styles and cultural elements that make the ancient story relevant to Ethiopian audiences.

### Literary Traditions

Beyond the *Kebra Nagast*, Ethiopian literature includes numerous poems, songs, and stories celebrating the Queen of Sheba. These works often emphasize her intelligence, her political acumen, and her role as a cultural bridge between Ethiopia and the broader Middle Eastern world.

Oral traditions preserved by Ethiopian storytellers have maintained and elaborated upon the Queen of Sheba narrative, ensuring its continued relevance in popular culture and national consciousness.

### Modern Cultural Impact

In contemporary Ethiopia, the Queen of Sheba remains a powerful symbol of Ethiopian heritage and identity. Her image appears in various forms of popular culture, from literature and film to tourism promotion and national celebrations.

The ongoing cultural relevance of the Queen of Sheba demonstrates the enduring power of her story to inspire Ethiopian national pride and cultural identity, regardless of questions about her historical existence.

## Scholarly Debates and Interpretations

Modern scholarship has approached the Queen of Sheba from various perspectives, examining archaeological evidence, textual analysis, and comparative studies of ancient Middle Eastern and African civilizations.

### Archaeological Investigations

Archaeological work in both Yemen and northern Ethiopia has sought evidence for the historical kingdoms that might have been ruled by the Queen of Sheba. While no direct archaeological evidence for the queen herself has been found, excavations have revealed sophisticated ancient civilizations in both regions that could have supported such a ruler.

Sites such as Yeha in Tigray have revealed evidence of advanced architecture, urban planning, and trade networks that demonstrate the political and economic sophistication of ancient northern Ethiopian societies during the relevant time period.

### Textual and Historical Analysis

Scholars have analyzed the biblical, Quranic, and Ethiopian textual traditions to understand how the Queen of Sheba narrative developed over time and across different cultural contexts. This analysis reveals how different traditions emphasized different aspects of her story to serve their particular religious and cultural purposes.

Comparative studies of ancient Middle Eastern and African queenship have provided context for understanding how female rulers functioned in these societies and how their stories were preserved and transmitted across generations.

### Theories About Historical Location

Scholarly opinion remains divided about the historical location of the Queen of Sheba's kingdom. Some scholars favor a South Arabian location in present-day Yemen, while others argue for an Ethiopian or broader Horn of African location. Still others suggest that the narrative may be a composite drawing on traditions from multiple historical kingdoms.

Recent archaeological discoveries in both regions continue to provide new evidence that may eventually help resolve these debates, though the legendary nature of much of the Queen of Sheba tradition means that definitive historical conclusions may remain elusive.

## Economic and Political Context

The Queen of Sheba narrative reflects the historical importance of trade networks that connected Africa, Arabia, and the Mediterranean world in ancient times.

### Ancient Trade Networks

The wealth attributed to the Queen of Sheba in biblical and traditional accounts reflects the historical prosperity that could be generated by controlling ancient trade routes. The Red Sea region was crucial for trade in gold, ivory, spices, and other luxury goods that connected African producers with Middle Eastern and Mediterranean markets.

Archaeological evidence demonstrates that ancient societies in both Yemen and northern Ethiopia were actively engaged in these trade networks and possessed the economic resources necessary to support powerful rulers and elaborate courts.

### Political Organization

The Queen of Sheba narrative suggests sophisticated political organization that could mobilize resources for long-distance diplomatic missions and maintain stable governance over diverse populations. This reflects the historical reality of ancient African and Arabian kingdoms that developed complex administrative systems and diplomatic relationships.

The emphasis on the queen's wisdom and her consultation with advisors in various traditional accounts reflects ancient Middle Eastern and African concepts of good governance that emphasized collective decision-making and the importance of wise counsel.

## Gender and Power in Ancient Contexts

The Queen of Sheba narrative provides important insights into ancient concepts of female rulership and political power.

### Female Rulership Traditions

The acceptance of the Queen of Sheba as a legitimate ruler in biblical, Quranic, and Ethiopian traditions reflects historical precedents for female political leadership in ancient Middle Eastern and African societies. Archaeological and textual evidence demonstrates that women held significant political power in various ancient civilizations in these regions.

The emphasis on her wisdom and diplomatic skills rather than military conquest reflects ancient ideals about how effective rulers should exercise power, regardless of gender. This aspect of her story has made her a model for later discussions about women's political capabilities and leadership styles.

### Intersection of Religion and Politics

The Queen of Sheba narrative demonstrates how ancient societies understood the relationship between religious legitimacy and political authority. Her recognition of Solomon's God and her own religious transformation are portrayed as enhancing rather than diminishing her political authority.

This integration of religious and political themes reflects the historical reality of ancient Middle Eastern and African societies where rulers were expected to maintain proper relationships with divine powers as part of their political responsibilities.

## Modern Ethiopian Identity and Nationalism

The Queen of Sheba tradition has played a significant role in modern Ethiopian nationalism and cultural identity formation.

This tradition was particularly important during periods when Ethiopia faced external challenges or when rulers needed to assert their legitimacy against internal competitors. The Queen of Sheba narrative provided a powerful symbol of Ethiopian sovereignty and cultural distinctiveness.

### Cultural Resistance and Pride

During the colonial period and in the face of various external pressures, the Queen of Sheba tradition served as a source of cultural pride and resistance. The narrative emphasized Ethiopia's ancient civilization, its biblical connections, and its historical independence in ways that challenged European stereotypes about African societies.

Contemporary Ethiopian cultural movements continue to draw on the Queen of Sheba tradition as a symbol of African achievement and a source of inspiration for cultural and political development.
