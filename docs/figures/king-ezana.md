**King Ezana of Axum** (Ge'ez: ዔዛና, ʿĒzānā) was a ruler of the Kingdom of Axum, an ancient empire located in the highlands of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. His reign in the 4th century CE (circa 320s–360s) is considered a pivotal moment in the region's history, most notably for his conversion to Christianity, which he established as the state religion. This act fundamentally shaped the religious and cultural trajectory of Ethiopia and Eritrea for millennia.

His reign was also marked by significant military expansion, which solidified Axum's control over a vast territory stretching from the Nile Valley to the Arabian Peninsula.

## Early Life and Ascension

Ezana ascended to the throne as a child after the death of his father, King Ousanas. His mother, Sofya, served as regent until he came of age. During his youth, Ezana was tutored by Frumentius, a Christian scholar from Tyre (modern-day Lebanon). Frumentius and his brother Edesius had been shipwrecked on the Red Sea coast and brought to the Axumite court. Frumentius's teachings deeply influenced the young king and laid the groundwork for his eventual conversion.

## Conversion to Christianity

The most significant event of Ezana's reign was his abandonment of polytheism in favor of Christianity. This conversion is documented through archaeological evidence, most notably Axumite coins.

**Pre-Christian Coins:** Coins minted in the early part of Ezana's reign feature a disc and crescent, symbols associated with the southern Arabian deities Almaqah and Shams.

**Post-Christian Coins:** Coins from the latter half of his reign are the first in the world to feature the Christian Cross.

This transition on the kingdom's currency was a clear and powerful declaration of the new state religion. Following his own conversion, Ezana gave his tutor Frumentius permission to travel to Alexandria to request that a bishop be appointed for Axum. Athanasius, the Patriarch of Alexandria, consecrated Frumentius himself as the first bishop of the Kingdom of Axum. He became known as **Abba Salama** (Father of Peace) and is revered as a saint in the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churches.

## Military Campaigns and Expansion

King Ezana was a formidable military leader who significantly expanded the borders and influence of Axum. His military victories are detailed in several inscriptions he left behind.

The most famous of these is the **Ezana Stone**, a multi-lingual monument written in Ge'ez, Sabaean, and Greek. It records his subjugation of various peoples and territories. A key passage describes a major campaign to the west, where he defeated the Noba (Nubians) and conquered the Kingdom of Kush, destroying its capital, Meroë.

In his inscriptions, he refers to himself with the grand title: "Ezana, son of Ella Amida, king of Aksum and of Himyar and of Raydan and of Saba and of Salhen and of Tsiyamo and of Beja and of Kasu, king of kings."

## Legacy

King Ezana's legacy is immense and multifaceted:

1. **Religious Foundation:** By making Christianity the state religion, he set a course that would define the identity of the Ethiopian and Eritrean highlands for over 1,600 years, creating one of the oldest Christian states in the world.

2. **Political Unification:** His military conquests consolidated Axumite power, controlled vital Red Sea trade routes, and established a political dominance that lasted for centuries.

3. **Cultural Record:** The inscriptions he left behind, particularly the Ezana Stone, are invaluable historical documents that provide direct insight into the language, religion, and politics of the 4th-century Axumite Empire.

King Ezana is venerated as a saint by the Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, with his feast day celebrated on October 1st.
