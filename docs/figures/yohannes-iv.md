Emperor Yohannes IV (Tigrinya: ዮሃንስ ራብዓይ, birth name: Lij Kassa Mercha) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1871 to 1889 and one of the most significant rulers in Ethiopian history. Born in Tembien, Tigray, he was a skilled military leader who defended Ethiopia against both Egyptian and Italian colonial expansion.

## Early Life and Rise to Power

Born as Lij Kassa Mercha in Tembien woreda, Tigray, around 1837, he was the son of Shum Mercha Wolde Kidan and Woizero Silas Dimtsu. His early life was marked by the political instability of the Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes).

Kassa Mercha distinguished himself as a military commander and gradually gained control over much of Tigray. Following the death of Emperor Tewodros II in 1868, he competed for imperial power with other regional rulers.

## Imperial Reign (1871-1889)

### Coronation

On January 21, 1872, Kassa Mercha was crowned Emperor Yohannes IV at Axum, the ancient capital of the Axumite Kingdom. His coronation in Axum symbolically connected his reign to Ethiopia's ancient Christian heritage.

### Major Achievements

**Military Victories:**

- **Battle of Gundet (1875)**: Defeated Egyptian forces, establishing Ethiopian sovereignty
- **Battle of Gura (1876)**: Another decisive victory against Egyptian expansion
- **Unification Efforts**: Brought various Ethiopian regions under central control

**Religious and Cultural Policy:**

- Promoted Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity
- Supported church construction and religious education
- Maintained Ethiopia's independence during the European "Scramble for Africa"

### Challenges and Conflicts

Emperor Yohannes IV faced multiple challenges during his reign:

- Italian colonial ambitions in the Red Sea region
- Internal rebellions from competing noble houses
- Mahdist invasions from Sudan
- Coordination with other regional rulers like Menelik of Shewa

## Death and Legacy

Emperor Yohannes IV died on March 10, 1889, at the Battle of Gallabat (also known as the Battle of Metemma) while fighting Mahdist forces from Sudan. His death marked the end of an era and paved the way for Menelik II's rise to imperial power.

### Historical Significance
