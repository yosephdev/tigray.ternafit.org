The Tigray War, which raged from November 2020 to November 2022, was not a sudden eruption of violence but the culmination of years of escalating political tensions rooted in competing visions for the Ethiopian state. The war's devastating consequences will reverberate for generations, but understanding its origins requires examining the dramatic political shifts that preceded it.

## The End of TPLF Dominance (1991-2018)

From 1991 to 2018, the **Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)** was the core and most powerful component of the ruling **Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)** coalition, effectively controlling the country's political and economic levers. While this period saw significant economic development, it was also characterized by:

- **Political repression** and restrictions on civil liberties
- **Ethnic tensions** arising from perceptions that a Tigrayan minority (constituting roughly 6% of the population) held disproportionate power
- **Growing resentment** among other, larger ethnic groups like the Oromo and Amhara

### The Rise of Abiy Ahmed

Widespread anti-government protests, particularly from the Oromo community, led to a dramatic change in leadership within the EPRDF. In 2018, **Abiy Ahmed**, an Oromo politician, became Prime Minister, initiating a series of sweeping reforms that would fundamentally alter Ethiopia's political landscape.

## The Ideological Divide: Two Visions of Ethiopia

### Abiy's Centralized Vision

- **Dismantled the EPRDF coalition** and merged its constituent parties into the new **Prosperity Party** in 2019
- Promoted a **pan-Ethiopian nationalism** that emphasized unity over ethnic identity
- Advocated for **political centralization** and reduced regional autonomy

### TPLF's Federalist Response

The TPLF **vehemently refused** to join the Prosperity Party, viewing the move as:

- A direct assault on the principle of **ethnic federalism**
- An attack on the constitutional system they had architected
- A threat to **regional autonomy** guaranteed to ethnic states

!!! quote "Constitutional Crisis"
    This ideological clash formed the primary political fault line: a centralized, pan-Ethiopian vision versus a federation of autonomous ethnic nations.

## The Eritrea Factor: A Strategic Encirclement

Abiy's most significant foreign policy initiative proved to be a critical turning point: a historic **rapprochement with Eritrea** and its president, **Isaias Afwerki**, a long-standing and bitter enemy of the TPLF.

### The Peace Deal's Consequences

While the **Ethiopia-Eritrea peace deal** was celebrated internationally (earning Abiy the Nobel Peace Prize), it had profound strategic implications:

- Created a powerful **anti-TPLF alliance** on Tigray's northern border
- Effectively **cornered** the region's leadership
- Transformed an internal political dispute into an **existential security crisis** for the TPLF

## The Breaking Point: Electoral Crisis of 2020

### The COVID-19 Election Postponement

In 2020, the federal government **postponed national elections**, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. This decision became the immediate trigger for the conflict:

#### Federal Government Position

- Elections were postponed for **public health reasons**
- The decision was **constitutionally justified** under emergency powers

#### TPLF Response

- Rejected the postponement as an **unconstitutional power grab**
- Viewed it as Abiy's attempt to **extend his mandate illegally**
- Proceeded to hold **regional elections in September 2020**

### Escalating Tensions

The TPLF's decision to hold regional elections was met with severe federal government responses:

1. **Legal Challenge**: Federal government declared the elections **illegal**
2. **Economic Pressure**: Addis Ababa **cut federal funding** to Tigray
3. **Political Isolation**: TPLF described funding cuts as **"tantamount to a declaration of war"**

## The Immediate Triggers

### Military Positioning

By late 2020, both sides were preparing for potential conflict:

- **Federal forces** maintained significant presence in Tigray through the Northern Command
- **TPLF forces** controlled regional security apparatus and militias
- **Eritrean forces** were reportedly positioning along the northern border

### The Final Escalation

On **November 3, 2020**, fighting erupted when TPLF forces attacked the federal military's **Northern Command headquarters** in Mekelle. The TPLF claimed this was a **pre-emptive strike** against an imminent federal and Eritrean invasion.

    This attack marked the transition from political crisis to armed conflict, beginning what would become one of the deadliest wars of the 21st century.
