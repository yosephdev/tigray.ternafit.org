# AI-Assisted Content Generation Workflow

This document provides a systematic approach for using AI to generate high-quality articles for the Tigray Knowledge Base while maintaining academic standards and accuracy.

## The Master Prompt Template

Use this prompt with GitHub Copilot or other AI tools to generate content that matches our quality standards:

---

**COPY AND PASTE THIS PROMPT:**

```
Act as an expert historian and content writer for a digital knowledge base called the "Tigray Knowledge Base." The tone is scholarly, neutral, and informative, similar to a high-quality encyclopedia entry. All articles must be well-structured with Markdown headings, be factually dense, and end with "Sources" and "Further Reading" sections.

Here is a perfect example of a completed article for "King Ezana of Axum":

[INSERT THE COMPLETE KING EZANA ARTICLE HERE FROM figures/king-ezana.md]

Now, using that exact same structure, tone, and depth of research, please write a comprehensive article for the following historical figure from our list:

"[INSERT TARGET FIGURE NAME HERE]"

Ensure you cover the following aspects:
[INSERT SPECIFIC RESEARCH POINTS FOR THIS FIGURE]

Follow this exact structure:
1. Opening paragraph with name in local script, dates, and significance
2. Early Life/Background section
3. Major achievements/events (2-3 sections)
4. Legacy section with numbered points
5. Sources section (5+ academic references)
6. Further Reading section linking to related topics

Conclude with a status note indicating this article provides comprehensive coverage and suggesting areas for potential expansion.
