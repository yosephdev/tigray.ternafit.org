    - **Getachew Reda**: Now serves as Advisor for East African Affairs to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed
    - **Mulu Nega**: State Minister of Science and Higher Education (federal government)
    - **Abraham Belay**: Minister of Water, Irrigation and Electricity (federal government)

    **Cabinet Changes**: The new administration downsized the cabinet from 27 to 21 members, though complete roster details remain limited in public reporting.

#### Administrative Challenges

!!! warning "Governance Issues"

    - **Political Fragmentation**: Deep divisions within TPLF affecting governance
    - **Limited Federal Authority**: Ongoing tensions with federal oversight
    - **Capacity Constraints**: Shortage of qualified civil servants

### 1.2 TPLF Political Dynamics

The Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) continues to experience significant internal divisions that directly impact regional governance.

#### Current TPLF Leadership Split

!!! warning "Party Fragmentation"

    **Debretsion Faction**: Following the TPLF's 14th Congress in August 2024, Debretsion Gebremichael was re-elected as party chairman despite significant opposition.

    **Membership Revocations**: The TPLF under Debretsion revoked the membership of 16 key leaders, including former Interim President Getachew Reda, deepening the political split.

    **Governance Impact**: This internal division directly led to the federal government's decision to appoint Lt. General Tadesse Worede as the new Interim President in April 2025.

#### Tigray Interim Council

In February 2025, the **Tigray Interim Council** was established to provide guidance and oversight to the interim administration, though its effectiveness is limited by:

- Internal TPLF disputes affecting council composition
- Opposition parties questioning its legitimacy
- Unclear relationship with federal oversight mechanisms
- Limited representation from civil society groups

### 1.3 In-Depth Analysis: The Political Crisis of 2024-2025

!!! abstract "Analytical Report: Tigray's Precarious Transition"

    The following analysis provides comprehensive insight into the dramatic political transformation that occurred in Tigray during 2024-2025, fundamentally altering the region's governance structure and relationship with the federal government.

#### The Pretoria Fault Line: Ideological Divisions

The **November 2022 Pretoria Peace Agreement** created a fundamental schism within the TPLF leadership:

**The Pragmatist Faction** (Led by Getachew Reda):
- Prioritized constructive engagement with federal government
- Focused on humanitarian aid, reconstruction, and stability
- Viewed the peace agreement as necessary foundation for recovery
- Supported cooperative implementation of peace provisions

**The Hardliner/Old Guard Faction** (Led by Debretsion Gebremichael):
- Viewed the peace agreement as "capitulation" to Addis Ababa
- Maintained deep mistrust of federal government intentions
- Opposed implementation of controversial provisions (DDR, territorial disputes)
- Advocated confrontational stance to reclaim occupied territories

#### Timeline of Political Rupture (August 2024 - April 2025)

**August-September 2024: The Formal Split**
- TPLF's 14th Congress re-elected Debretsion as chairman
- Getachew Reda and allies boycotted, disputing legitimacy
- Congress replaced Getachew with Amanuel Assefa as deputy chairman
- Formal expulsion of Getachew and 15 allies from TPLF

**October 2024: Declaration of "Public Coup"**
- Debretsion-led TPLF announced "removal" of Getachew from presidency
- Accused his administration of exceeding transitional mandate
- Created political pressure despite lack of legal authority

**March 2025: Forceful Seizure of Power**
- Armed forces loyal to Debretsion faction seized government infrastructure
- Took control of administrative offices, radio stations, municipal buildings
- Getachew Reda fled Mekelle for Addis Ababa
- Created fait accompli forcing federal government decision

**April 8, 2025: Federal Ratification**
- PM Abiy Ahmed appointed Lt. General Tadesse Worede as new president
- Decision prioritized de-escalation over principle
- Getachew Reda appointed as federal "Advisor for East African Affairs"

#### Current Administration Challenges

**Crisis of Legitimacy**:
- Three major opposition parties rejected new cabinet as unrepresentative
- Administration accused of "coming to power by force"
- Violates Pretoria Agreement's requirement for inclusive governance
- Lacks popular mandate from Tigrayan electorate

**Mandate Contradictions**:
- Formally obligated to implement Pretoria Agreement provisions
- Political base opposes key aspects of the same agreement
- Creates structural paralysis on controversial issues
- Particularly affects DDR process and territorial dispute resolution

**Territorial Control Limitations**:
- Approximately 40% of pre-war Tigray remains under Amhara/Eritrean control
- Includes Western Tigray (Welkait), Southern zones, parts of North-Eastern zones
- Prevents IDP returns and service restoration
- Undermines administration's credibility and effectiveness

#### Strategic Implications

**Federal Government Calculations**:
- Chose short-term stability over long-term principle
- Avoided immediate military confrontation
- Risk of legitimizing hardline faction less committed to peace
- Co-opted former president to prevent spoiler activities

**Regional Security Risks**:
- Potential TPLF-Eritrea rapprochement threatens regional stability
- Western Tigray remains primary flashpoint for renewed conflict
- DDR process stalled due to security concerns
- Risk of proxy conflicts involving external actors

**Peace Process Durability**:
- Core Pretoria Agreement provisions remain unimplemented
- Hardline leadership less predictable and cooperative
- Increased likelihood of "frozen conflict" scenario
- Long-term viability of peace framework in question

#### Key Monitoring Indicators (2025-2026)

**Political Stability Measures**:
- Opposition party freedom of operation
- Progress toward regional elections
- National dialogue participation levels
- TPLF-federal government rhetoric and engagement

**Security Situation Tracking**:
- DDR implementation pace and transparency
- Military posture changes along territorial boundaries
- Internal security incidents and political violence
- Intelligence on TPLF-Eritrea coordination

**Humanitarian and Economic Recovery**:
- IDP return rates, especially to contested territories
- Humanitarian access restrictions
- Civil servant salary payment resolution
- Natural resource management transparency

This analysis reveals that Tigray's current political situation represents not merely a leadership change, but a fundamental transformation in the region's relationship with the peace process and federal government. The implications extend far beyond Tigray's borders, affecting the stability of the entire Horn of Africa region.
