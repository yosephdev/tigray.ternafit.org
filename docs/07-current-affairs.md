## 1. Current Governance Structure

### 1.1 Interim Regional Administration

Following the November 2022 peace agreement, Tigray remains under a federally-appointed Interim Regional Administration, reconfigured in April 2025 amid deepening TPLF party divisions. Senior leadership largely unchanged since April, but cabinet appointments remain contested amid ongoing opposition protests.

#### Key Leadership (October 2025)

| Position | Official | Appointed | Background |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Interim President** | Lt. Gen. Tadesse Worede | April 8, 2025 | Former TDF Commander-in-Chief, mediated recent TDF integration talks |
| **Deputy President** | Amanuel Assefa | April 2025 | Academic, oversaw recent budget negotiations |
| **Security Bureau Head** | Gen. Fiseha Kidanu | April 2025 | Directed recent border stabilization efforts |

#### Leadership Changes and Political Context

!!! info "Recent Developments"

    In October, the interim cabinet expelled two members over alleged corruption linked to education reconstruction funds.

    Getachew Reda, former president, remains federal Advisor on East African Affairs.

    National dialogue delegation to Tigray postponed amid security concerns.

#### Administrative Challenges

!!! warning "Governance Updates"

    **Cabinet expansion**: Two new economic advisory roles added; total cabinet size now 23.

    **Opposition Concerns**: Three opposition blocs launched a petition—over 12,000 signatures—demanding an elected government by May 2026.

### 1.2 TPLF Political Dynamics

Internal struggle persists: the Debretsion faction dominates party organs, with recent attempts at fractious reunification failing. Expelled members formed the Tigray Renewal Movement, calling for international election observers.

### 1.3 In-Depth Analysis: The Political Crisis of 2024-2025

Federal mediation efforts have increased, but the Pretoria peace implementation remains incomplete. DDR (Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration) stalled, with only 40% of ex-combatants enrolled in current federal programs.
