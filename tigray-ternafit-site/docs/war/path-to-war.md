## Overview

The Tigray War (November 2020 – November 2022) was not a sudden eruption but the culmination of escalating political tensions rooted in competing visions for the Ethiopian state. Understanding its origins requires examining the political shifts that preceded it.

## The End of TPLF Dominance (1991-2018)

From 1991 to 2018, the **Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)** was the dominant component of the ruling **Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)** coalition.

This period was characterized by:

- Significant economic development
- Political restrictions and civil liberties concerns
- Tensions arising from perceptions of disproportionate Tigrayan influence in federal politics
- Growing demands for change from other ethnic groups, particularly Oromo and Amhara communities

### The Rise of Abiy Ahmed

Widespread anti-government protests, particularly from the Oromo community, led to leadership changes within the EPRDF. In 2018, **Abiy Ahmed**, an Oromo politician, became Prime Minister and initiated sweeping reforms.

## The Ideological Divide

### Federal Government Position

The Abiy administration pursued:

- Dissolution of the EPRDF coalition and formation of the **Prosperity Party** (2019)
- Promotion of pan-Ethiopian nationalism emphasizing unity
- Political centralization and reduced regional autonomy

### TPLF Position

The TPLF refused to join the Prosperity Party, viewing the changes as:

- An assault on ethnic federalism principles
- A threat to the constitutional system
- A challenge to regional autonomy guaranteed to ethnic states

This disagreement formed the primary political fault line leading to conflict.

## The Eritrea Factor

The Ethiopia-Eritrea peace agreement (2018) had significant implications:

- Created an alliance between the federal government and Eritrea
- Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki had long-standing enmity with the TPLF
- The agreement effectively isolated Tigray regionally
- Transformed internal political tensions into broader security concerns

---

## The Electoral Crisis of 2020

### Election Postponement

In 2020, the federal government postponed national elections, citing the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Federal Government Position**: Elections were postponed for public health reasons under emergency powers.

**TPLF Response**: The postponement was rejected as unconstitutional. The TPLF proceeded to hold regional elections in September 2020.

### Escalating Tensions

The federal government's responses included:

- Declaring the regional elections illegal
- Cutting federal funding to Tigray
- Political isolation of TPLF leadership

The TPLF described the funding cuts as tantamount to a declaration of war.

---

## The Outbreak of War

On **November 3, 2020**, fighting erupted when TPLF forces attacked the federal military's Northern Command headquarters in Mekelle.

The TPLF characterized this as a pre-emptive strike against an imminent federal and Eritrean military operation. The federal government characterized it as an attack on national defense forces.

This marked the beginning of armed conflict that would continue until November 2022.
