## Topography

### Highland Plateau

The majority of Tigray consists of highland plateau terrain.

**Elevation characteristics:**

- General elevation: 1,500-3,000 meters
- Highest elevations exceed 3,900 meters
- Flat-topped mountains (ambas) characteristic of the landscape

### The Amba Landscape

Ambas (flat-topped mountains with steep escarpments) are distinctive features of Tigrayan geography, historically significant for settlement and defense.

### River Systems

**Major rivers:**

- Tekeze River: Primary river system, tributary of the Nile
- Gash (Mareb) River: Northern river system
- Numerous seasonal streams and watercourses

### Lowland Areas

- Western lowlands below 1,500 meters
- Eastern escarpment transitioning to Afar lowlands
- Different climate and agricultural patterns than highlands

---

## Climate

### General Characteristics

- Semi-arid to sub-humid climate
- Distinct wet and dry seasons
- Significant variation by elevation

### Rainy Season

- Primary rains: June-September (approximately 50-60 days)
- Critical for agricultural production
- Significant year-to-year variability

### Dry Season

- Extended dry period: October-May
- Water scarcity challenges
- Cool highlands, hot lowlands

### Climate Zones

Multiple climate zones based on elevation:

- Highland (above 2,000m): Moderate temperatures
- Mid-altitude (1,500-2,000m): Warmer, variable rainfall
- Lowland (below 1,500m): Hot, semi-arid conditions

---

## Environmental Challenges

### Rainfall Variability

- Significant inter-annual variation
- Periodic drought conditions
- Flood risk during intense rainfall periods

### Soil Erosion

- Steep terrain susceptible to erosion
- Historical deforestation contributing to degradation
- Conservation efforts documented in some areas

### Climate Change

- Increasing climate variability reported
- Impacts on agricultural patterns
- Water resource challenges

---

## Settlement Patterns

### Highland Concentration

- Majority of population in highland areas
- Preference for elevations 2,000-2,500 meters
- Agricultural suitability driving settlement

### Urban Centers

- **Mekelle**: Regional capital and largest city
- **Adigrat**: Northern city
- **Aksum**: Historic and religious center
- **Adwa**: Administrative center

### Rural Settlement

- Dispersed village pattern
- Settlements often near water sources
- Churches and markets as community centers

---

## Transportation

### Road Network

- Main highways connecting to Addis Ababa and regional cities
- Variable road quality, particularly in rural areas
- Terrain challenges for infrastructure

### Air Transport

- Mekelle airport (Alula Aba Nega Airport)
- Regional airstrips

## Administrative Divisions

Tigray is divided into zones and woredas (districts) for administrative purposes.

*Note: Administrative boundaries and current governance arrangements should be verified with current official sources.*
