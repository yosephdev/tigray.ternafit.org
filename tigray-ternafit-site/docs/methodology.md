3. **Disrupted Data Collection**: Census and survey activities were disrupted by the conflict, limiting current demographic data.

4. **Territorial Disputes**: Ongoing disputes affect some administrative and demographic data.

5. **Limited Scholarship**: Some historical and cultural topics have limited available academic scholarship.

6. **Language Barriers**: Some source materials are not available in English, potentially limiting coverage.
