## The Aksumite Empire (c. 100-940 CE)

### Rise to Power

Aksum emerged as a major power due to:

- Control of the port of Adulis

### Geographic Extent

At its height, Aksumite influence extended across:

- Modern Tigray and Eritrea
- Parts of modern Sudan

- Aksum became one of the earliest states to adopt Christianity officially
- Established religious traditions continuing to present day

- Diplomatic connections with Byzantine Empire

### Economic Foundation

The Aksumite economy was based on:

- International trade via the Red Sea
- Agricultural surplus from highland farming
- Minting of gold, silver, and bronze coinage
- Tribute from subject territories

### Cultural Achievements

Documented achievements include:

- Monumental stelae (obelisks) at Aksum, some reaching 33 meters
- Development of the Ge'ez script and language
- Sophisticated stone architecture
