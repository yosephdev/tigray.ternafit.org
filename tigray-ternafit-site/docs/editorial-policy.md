# Editorial Policy

## Core Principles

### 1. Source-Based Documentation

All factual claims should be supported by cited sources. We do not present unverified claims as established facts.

**Acceptable source types include:**

- Reports from United Nations agencies and bodies
- Publications from established human rights organizations
- Peer-reviewed academic research
- Official government documents and statistics
- Verified reporting from established news organizations

### 2. Acknowledgment of Uncertainty

Where information is contested, incomplete, or derived from limited sources, this is explicitly stated. Estimates are presented as estimates, not as verified facts.

**Example**: Rather than "500,000 people died," we write "Estimates of conflict-related deaths vary; a widely-cited study suggests a range of 300,000-500,000, though precise figures remain unknown."

### 3. Attribution Over Assertion

Findings from investigations are attributed to the investigating organization rather than presented as independent conclusions of this platform.

**Example**: "Amnesty International documented mass killings in Axum" rather than "Mass killings occurred in Axum."

### 4. Neutrality in Presentation

Content aims for neutral presentation of documented information. We present what credible sources have documented without editorial commentary that endorses particular political positions.

Analysis and interpretation, where present, are clearly distinguished from factual documentation.

### 5. Transparency About Limitations

We are explicit about what we do not know, what cannot be verified, and where data is incomplete. Admitting limitations is preferable to overstating certainty.
