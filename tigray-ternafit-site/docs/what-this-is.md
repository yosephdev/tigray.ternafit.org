## What This Knowledge Base Is Not

### Not an authoritative academic publication

While we strive for academic standards, this is a community-maintained resource, not a peer-reviewed journal or institutional publication.

### Not an independent investigative body

We compile and synthesize findings from international organizations and researchers. We do not conduct original field investigations or independently verify individual incidents.

### Not comprehensive

Coverage is necessarily incomplete. Many topics remain in development or require additional documentation.

### Not politically affiliated

This platform is not affiliated with any government, political party, or armed group. Documentation of events does not constitute endorsement of any party's political position.

### Not a substitute for primary sources

Users should consult original reports, academic publications, and official documents for authoritative information.

### Not free from error

Despite efforts at accuracy, errors may exist. We welcome corrections with supporting documentation.
